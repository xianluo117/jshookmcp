# Debugger

Domain: `debugger`

CDP-based debugging domain covering breakpoints, stepping, call stacks, watches, and debugger sessions.

## Profiles

- workflow
- full

## Typical scenarios

- Set and hit breakpoints
- Evaluate expressions in frames
- Save and restore debugger sessions

## Common combinations

- debugger + hooks
- debugger + antidebug

## Representative tools

- `debugger_enable` — Enable the debugger (must be called before setting breakpoints)
- `debugger_disable` — Disable the debugger and clear all breakpoints
- `debugger_pause` — Pause execution at the next statement
- `debugger_resume` — Resume execution (continue)
- `debugger_step_into` — Step into the next function call
- `debugger_step_over` — Step over the next function call
- `debugger_step_out` — Step out of the current function
- `breakpoint_set` — Set a breakpoint at a specific location. Supports URL-based and scriptId-based breakpoints with optional conditions.
- `breakpoint_remove` — Remove a breakpoint by its ID
- `breakpoint_list` — List all active breakpoints
