## Profiles

- workflow
- full

## Typical scenarios

- Capture function calls
- Persist runtime evidence
- Install team-specific inline presets

## Common combinations

- browser + hooks + debugger

## Representative tools

- `ai_hook_generate` — Generate hook code for a target function, API, or object method.
- `ai_hook_inject` — Inject a generated hook into the page.
- `ai_hook_get_data` — Retrieve captured data from an active hook (arguments, return values, timestamps, call count)
- `ai_hook_list` — List all active hooks with their IDs, types, creation time, and call counts
- `ai_hook_clear` — Remove one hook by ID or clear all hooks and their captured data
- `ai_hook_toggle` — Enable or disable a hook without removing it
- `ai_hook_export` — Export captured hook data in JSON or CSV format
- `hook_preset` — Install a pre-built JavaScript hook from 20+ built-in presets (eval, atob/btoa, Proxy, Reflect, Object.defineProperty, etc.), or provide customTemplate/customTemplates to install your own reusable hook bodies. Use listPresets=true to see all available preset descriptions.
