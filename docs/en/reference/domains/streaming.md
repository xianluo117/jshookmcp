# Streaming

Domain: `streaming`

WebSocket and SSE monitoring domain.

## Profiles

- workflow
- full

## Typical scenarios

- Capture WebSocket frames
- Monitor SSE events

## Common combinations

- browser + streaming + network

## Representative tools

- `ws_monitor_enable` — Enable WebSocket frame capture via CDP Network events (webSocketFrameSent / webSocketFrameReceived).
- `ws_monitor_disable` — Disable WebSocket monitoring and return capture summary.
- `ws_get_frames` — Get captured WebSocket frames with pagination and optional payload regex filter.
- `ws_get_connections` — Get tracked WebSocket connections and frame counts.
- `sse_monitor_enable` — Enable SSE monitoring by injecting an EventSource constructor interceptor in page context. Supports persistent mode to survive navigations.
- `sse_get_events` — Get captured SSE events with filters and pagination.
