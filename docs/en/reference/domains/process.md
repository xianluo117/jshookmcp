# Process

Domain: `process`

Process, module, memory diagnostics, and controlled injection domain for host-level inspection, troubleshooting, and Windows process experimentation workflows.

## Profiles

- full

## Typical scenarios

- Enumerate processes and inspect modules
- Diagnose memory failures and export audit trails
- Perform controlled DLL/shellcode injection in opt-in environments

## Common combinations

- process + debugger
- process + platform

## Representative tools

- `electron_attach` — Connect to a running Electron app (VS Code, Cursor, etc.) via CDP and inspect/execute JS. Useful for debugging Electron applications or extracting extension data.
- `process_find` — Find processes by name pattern. Returns process IDs, names, paths, and window handles.
- `process_list` — List all running processes. Alias of process_find with empty pattern.
- `process_get` — Get detailed information about a specific process by PID.
- `process_windows` — Get all window handles for a process.
- `process_find_chromium` — Disabled by design: does not scan user-installed browser processes. Use managed browser sessions (browser_launch/browser_attach with explicit endpoint) instead.
- `process_check_debug_port` — Check if a process has a debug port enabled for CDP attachment.
- `process_launch_debug` — Launch an executable with remote debugging port enabled.
- `process_kill` — Kill a process by PID.
- `memory_read` — Read memory from a process at a specific address. Failures include structured diagnostics for permissions, region checks, and ASLR guidance.
