# Memory

Domain: `memory`

Memory analysis domain for native scans, pointer-chain discovery, structure inference, and breakpoint-based observation.

## Profiles

- workflow
- full

## Typical scenarios

- Run first/next scans to narrow target values
- Analyze pointer chains and in-memory structures
- Manage scan sessions and memory breakpoints

## Common combinations

- memory + process
- memory + debugger
- memory + workflow

## Representative tools

- `memory_first_scan` — Start a new memory scan session. Scans entire process memory for a value and returns matching addresses. Supports all numeric types (byte/int8/int16/uint16/int32/uint32/int64/uint64/float/double/pointer) plus hex/string patterns. Creates a session for iterative narrowing with memory_next_scan.
- `memory_next_scan` — Narrow an existing scan session. Re-reads previously matched addresses and filters using a comparison mode. Use after memory_first_scan or memory_unknown_scan to iteratively narrow results (like Cheat Engine's "Next Scan").
- `memory_unknown_scan` — Start an unknown initial value scan. Captures all readable memory addresses of the given type, then use memory_next_scan with "changed"/"unchanged"/"increased"/"decreased" to narrow down. This is the CE equivalent of "Unknown initial value" scan.
- `memory_pointer_scan` — Find pointers to a target address. Scans process memory for pointer-sized values that point to or near the target address (within ±4096 bytes for struct member access).
- `memory_group_scan` — Search for multiple values at known offsets simultaneously. Useful for finding structures where you know the relative layout (e.g. health at +0, mana at +4, level at +8).
- `memory_scan_list` — List all active scan sessions, showing PID, value type, match count, scan count, and age.
- `memory_scan_delete` — Delete a scan session and free its resources.
- `memory_scan_export` — Export a scan session as JSON for persistence. Can be imported later to resume the scan workflow.
- `memory_pointer_chain_scan` — Multi-level pointer chain scan. Finds stable pointer paths from module-relative bases to a target address. Uses BFS to discover chains like [game.exe+0x1A3C] → [+0x10] → [+0x08] → target. Static chains (module-relative base) survive process restarts.
- `memory_pointer_chain_validate` — Validate pointer chains by re-dereferencing each link. Returns which chains are still valid and at which level broken chains fail.

| `memory_pointer_chain_resolve` | Resolve a pointer chain to its current target address by dereferencing each link. |
| `memory_pointer_chain_export` | Export pointer chains as JSON for persistence. Can be imported across sessions. |
| `memory_structure_analyze` | Analyze memory at an address to infer data structure layout. Uses heuristics to classify fields as vtable pointers, regular pointers, string pointers, floats, ints, booleans, or padding. Optionally parses RTTI for class name and inheritance chain (MSVC x64). |
| `memory_vtable_parse` | Parse a vtable to enumerate virtual function pointers and resolve them to module+offset. Also attempts RTTI parsing for class name and inheritance hierarchy. |
| `memory_structure_export_c` | Export an inferred structure as a C-style struct definition with offset comments and type annotations. |
| `memory_structure_compare` | Compare two structure instances to identify which fields differ (dynamic values like health/position) vs which are constant (vtable, type flags). Useful for finding important fields. |
| `memory_breakpoint_set` | Set a hardware breakpoint using x64 debug registers (DR0-DR3). Max 4 concurrent breakpoints. Supports read/write/readwrite/execute access monitoring. |

| `memory_breakpoint_list` | List all active hardware breakpoints with hit counts. |

| `memory_patch_bytes` | Write bytes to target process at address. Saves original bytes for undo. Use for runtime code patching. |
