# Maintenance

Domain: `maintenance`

Operations and maintenance domain covering cache hygiene, token budget, environment diagnostics, artifact cleanup, and extension management.

## Profiles

- search
- workflow
- full

## Typical scenarios

- Diagnose dependencies
- Clean retained artifacts
- Reload plugins and workflows

## Common combinations

- maintenance + workflow
- maintenance + extensions

## Representative tools

- `get_token_budget_stats` — Get current token budget usage statistics.
- `manual_token_cleanup` — Trigger token budget cleanup to free context space. Clears stale entries older than 5 minutes and resets counters. Frees 10-30% of token budget while preserving recent data.
- `reset_token_budget` — Hard-reset all token budget counters to zero. Destructive: clears all tracking history. Only use when MCP session state is corrupted. Prefer manual_token_cleanup for routine cleanup.
- `get_cache_stats` — Get cache statistics for all internal caches. Returns total entries, sizes, per-cache hit rates, TTL config, and cleanup recommendations.
- `smart_cache_cleanup` — Intelligently clean caches to free memory while preserving hot data. Evicts LRU entries, removes low-hit entries, and clears entries older than 2 hours.
- `clear_all_caches` — Clear all internal caches completely. Destructive: all cached data will be lost. Prefer smart_cache_cleanup for routine maintenance.
- `cleanup_artifacts` — Clean generated artifacts, screenshots, and debugger sessions using retention rules. Supports age-based removal, size-based trimming, and dry-run preview.
- `doctor_environment` — Run an environment doctor for optional dependencies, bridge endpoints, and platform limitations. Use before debugging dependency issues or after installing external integrations.
- `list_extensions` — List all locally loaded plugins, workflows, and extension tools with their details.
- `reload_extensions` — Reload all plugins and workflows from configured directories. Dynamically registers extension tools and refreshes tool list.
